							For this thought exercise I want to talk about various reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically the actor-critic models and their implication in video games AI. Reinforcement learning is a method inspired from behavioural psychology. This is exactly how dogs are train and how living beings usually learn. The way it works in computer code is by applying the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman equations. The MDP says that an agent exists in a probabilistic state at any given time and takes an action based on its observations. The environment rewards the agent if the action was towards the goal or punishes it otherwise. The problem with this model is that the programmer has to decide what a good action is and how the agent is going to be rewarded. To fix this issue a second neural network, the critic, was added to the model, hence, the actor-critic. The role of the critic is to learn what the goal is and asses the agent actions.

							With the advancement made in Reinforcement Learning in the last couple of years we see the effects of this technology in video games where pro players are beaten by the AI in real time strategy games. When using a finite state machine in a game, the decision-making process is planned out before playing the game. In reinforcement learning algorithms the decision-making is done by the computer during gameplay which gives it a human-like appearance. This kind of AI does not have intuition or prior knowledge about the world which was shown in experiments. For example, humans and AI were told to play a very simple arcade game. The humans reached the goal very fast due to their prior knowledge about game design. However, when the textures were shuffled in the game people had problem winning the game. The AI took constantly the same amount of time to win the game. This tells us that the AI can solve different problems with the same algorithm, and this is the beauty of machine learning. It can be repurposed for other real-world problems.

						<p>There are numerous questions related to reinforcement learning in games. For example, is it viable to have this sort of AI enemies in RPGs when the player becomes too powerful? I would say it will bring a challenge to players who loose interest in the game once they achieved too much. Would reinforcement learning be a good solution for pathfinding besides A*? Is this the dawn of General AI? </p>
